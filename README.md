Image Classification for Cars vs Planes
=======================================

Welcome to the Image Classification for Cars vs Planes repository! This project focuses on utilizing machine learning techniques to classify images of cars and planes. The goal is to create an accurate and efficient image classification model that can distinguish between these two classes with high precision.

Project Overview
----------------

In this repository, you will find the following components:

1.  Dataset: The `dataset` directory contains the image data used for training and testing the classification model. The dataset is divided into two subdirectories: `cars` and `planes`, each containing labeled images of the respective class.

2.  Notebooks: The `notebooks` directory holds Jupyter notebooks that walk you through the process of building, training, and evaluating the image classification model. The notebooks are structured as follows:

    -   `1_data_preprocessing.ipynb`: Data preprocessing and augmentation steps performed on the dataset.
    -   `2_model_training.ipynb`: Model architecture design and training using TensorFlow/Keras.
    -   `3_model_evaluation.ipynb`: Evaluation of the trained model on a test dataset and performance analysis.
3.  Trained Model: After training, the trained model and its weights will be saved in the `models` directory.

4.  Results: The `results` directory contains visualizations and metrics summarizing the model's performance.
