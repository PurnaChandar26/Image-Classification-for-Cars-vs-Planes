Image Classification for Cars vs Planes
=======================================

Welcome to the Image Classification for Cars vs Planes repository! This project focuses on utilizing transfer learning techniques to classify images of cars and planes. The goal is to create an accurate and efficient image classification model that can distinguish between these two classes with high precision.

Project Overview
----------------

In this repository, we have developed a Jupyter notebook that demonstrates the process of building, training, and using an image classification model for distinguishing between cars and planes.

### Notebook Contents

The main tasks covered in the Jupyter notebook are:

1.  **Importing Necessary Packages:** We start by importing the required libraries such as TensorFlow, Keras, and others for building and training the image classification model.

2.  **Use Pretrained Model using Transfer Learning:** We utilize the power of transfer learning by loading a pretrained convolutional neural network (CNN) model (e.g., VGG16, ResNet50) that has been trained on a large dataset. We freeze the pre-trained layers and add a custom classification head to the model.

3.  **Train the Model:** We demonstrate how to load and preprocess the dataset. We then train the model on the training data, fine-tuning the custom classification head while keeping the pre-trained layers frozen.

4.  **Save Model:** After training, we save the trained model architecture and weights to disk for future use.

5.  **Prediction using the Model:** We showcase how to use the trained model for making predictions on new, unseen images.

6.  **Using the Saved Model:** We provide an example of how to load the saved model and its weights from disk.

7.  **Main Class to Link All Methods:** We encapsulate all the methods and functionalities into a main class for ease of use and organization.

8.  **Methods to Run our Planes vs Cars Recognizer:** We define methods that encapsulate the process of running the image classification model on new images.

9.  **Running Our Planes vs Cars Recognizer:** We demonstrate how to use the methods defined earlier to classify new images of cars and planes.
